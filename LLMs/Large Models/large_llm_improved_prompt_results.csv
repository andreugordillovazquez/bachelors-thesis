qwen/qwen2.5-3b-instruct;What is modulation in digital communications?;Modulation is the process of encoding digital data onto a carrier signal by varying its amplitude, frequency, or phase. In digital communications, it maps bits to signal points in a constellation (e.g., BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM) for transmission over a channel. Key parameters include modulation type, signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), data rate, and constellation size. It enables efficient use of bandwidth and facilitates error analysis via metrics like bit error rate (BER) or symbol error probability.;8.832;8.4

qwen/qwen2.5-3b-instruct;What does increasing block length N do to the probability of error?;Increasing block length $ N $ generally reduces the probability of error for a given SNR, as longer blocks allow more effective error correction coding. However, the exact relationship depends on modulation type, SNR, and rate. For a fixed SNR and rate, the error probability decreases exponentially with $ N $ in the high-SNR regime.

It maps 3 bits per symbol, offering higher data rates than 4-QAM but with increased complexity and susceptibility to noise. 8-QAM is used in applications requiring moderate data rates and bandwidth efficiency, such as digital television, wireless communications, and certain data transmission systems, where trade-offs between spectral efficiency and implementation complexity are acceptable.;14.512;5.3
