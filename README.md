# Bachelor's Thesis

This repository contains the code and resources for my bachelorâ€™s thesis project, which focuses on the implementation and analysis of various language models for a communication systems simulation tool.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into two main directories:

### LLMs/
This directory contains different implementations and variations of language models:
- `Large Models/`: Implementation of larger language models
- `Fine-tuned Model/`: Custom fine-tuned language model implementations
- `Lightweight Models/`: Lighter versions of language models for specific use cases

### MATLAB/
This directory contains MATLAB implementations and analysis tools:
- `main.mlx`: Main MATLAB script for analysis and visualization
- `functions/`: Collection of MATLAB functions used in the analysis
